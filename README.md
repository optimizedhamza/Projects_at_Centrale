This initiative is particularly focused on enhancing the security framework of Zen Networks against potential frauds.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Cloud Computing:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- **Machine Learning Platform:** Amazon SageMaker
- **Data Processing:** Apache Spark
- **API Management:** AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway

**Key Features:**
1. **Efficient Data Processing:** Utilizes Apache Spark for handling and analyzing large-scale IoT datasets, facilitating the efficient processing of millions of data rows.
2. **Unsupervised Machine Learning Models:** Employs unsupervised learning techniques within Amazon SageMaker, utilizing algorithms like RandomCutForest for anomaly detection in unlabeled data.
3. **Scalable Deployment Architecture:** Features a scalable solution for deploying machine learning models, integrating Amazon SageMaker-managed endpoints with AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway to create a robust REST API service for real-time fraud detection.
4. **Dual Dataset Analysis:** Conducts a thorough analysis of two distinct datasets: Zen Network's telecommunications session data and anonymized credit card transactions, demonstrating the model's adaptability to various data types for fraud detection.

### Dynamic Artistic Weather Wallpaper Application

**Description:** This project creates a unique desktop experience by dynamically updating the wallpaper based on the current weather conditions. It leverages real-time weather data and AI-powered image generation to craft artistic representations of the weather, providing a visually engaging desktop environment. The application is equipped with a user-friendly GUI, allowing for straightforward setup and customization.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **APIs:** Eden AI for image generation, OpenWeatherMap for weather data
- **GUI Framework:** tkinter (Python)
- **Other Tools:** Python libraries for API interaction and image processing

**Key Features:**
1. **Real-time Weather Data Integration:** Utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather conditions.
2. **AI-Powered Artistic Image Generation:** Leverages the Eden AI API to generate wallpapers that artistically represent the current weather.
3. **Customizable Update Frequency:** Allows users to specify how often the wallpaper should update to reflect changes in weather conditions.
4. **Simple GUI for Easy Configuration:** Includes a straightforward graphical user interface for setting up the application, including API key input and update frequency customization.

### Detection of Bots in Online Auctions

**Description:** This project focuses on the critical task of identifying automated bots (bots) in online auctions. Bots are automated programs that can disrupt the smooth operation of auction platforms by placing inappropriate or fraudulent bids. Detecting these entities is essential for preserving the integrity and trustworthiness of online auction platforms, ensuring all participants engage in a fair and transparent bidding environment. The project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze bidder behavior and auction patterns, distinguishing between human and automated bot activities.

**Technologies Used**
- **Data Analysis and Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Feature Engineering Techniques**: Time Series Analysis, Statistical Analysis

**Key Features**
1. **Comprehensive Data Cleaning**: Addresses missing values and cleans datasets for accurate analysis.
2. **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Extracts meaningful attributes from raw data, focusing on distinguishing characteristics between bots and humans.
3. **Machine Learning Model Evaluation**: Employs various models including Logistic Regression, RandomForest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting, with a detailed evaluation of their performance.
4. **Handling Data Imbalance**: Utilizes techniques like SMOTE to address imbalances in the dataset, ensuring models are not biased towards the majority class.
5. **Model Optimization**: Applies GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning of machine learning models to enhance detection accuracy.
6. **Insightful Visualizations**: Generates plots and charts for an in-depth exploration of data and to visualize the performance of models.
