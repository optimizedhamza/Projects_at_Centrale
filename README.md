## Projects

### Fraud and Anomaly Detection in IoT Data Using Machine Learning

**Description:** This project aims to address the significant challenge of detecting fraudulent activities and anomalies within the Internet of Things (IoT) data landscape. Leveraging the power of cloud computing and advanced machine learning techniques, it develops scalable, self-improving models for identifying irregularities in massive IoT datasets. Utilizing Amazon SageMaker for training unsupervised machine learning models on historical IoT data, the project showcases the deployment of these models via a REST API, enabling seamless integration into existing business infrastructures. This initiative is particularly focused on enhancing the security framework of Zen Networks against potential frauds.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Cloud Computing:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- **Machine Learning Platform:** Amazon SageMaker
- **Data Processing:** Apache Spark
- **API Management:** AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway

**Key Features:**
1. **Efficient Data Processing:** Utilizes Apache Spark for handling and analyzing large-scale IoT datasets, facilitating the efficient processing of millions of data rows.
2. **Unsupervised Machine Learning Models:** Employs unsupervised learning techniques within Amazon SageMaker, utilizing algorithms like RandomCutForest for anomaly detection in unlabeled data.
3. **Scalable Deployment Architecture:** Features a scalable solution for deploying machine learning models, integrating Amazon SageMaker-managed endpoints with AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway to create a robust REST API service for real-time fraud detection.
4. **Dual Dataset Analysis:** Conducts a thorough analysis of two distinct datasets: Zen Network's telecommunications session data and anonymized credit card transactions, demonstrating the model's adaptability to various data types for fraud detection.

### Project: Dynamic Artistic Weather Wallpaper Application

**Description:** This project creates a unique desktop experience by dynamically updating the wallpaper based on the current weather conditions. It leverages real-time weather data and AI-powered image generation to craft artistic representations of the weather, providing a visually engaging desktop environment. The application is equipped with a user-friendly GUI, allowing for straightforward setup and customization.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **APIs:** Eden AI for image generation, OpenWeatherMap for weather data
- **GUI Framework:** tkinter (Python)
- **Other Tools:** Python libraries for API interaction and image processing

**Key Features:**
1. **Real-time Weather Data Integration:** Utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather conditions.
2. **AI-Powered Artistic Image Generation:** Leverages the Eden AI API to generate wallpapers that artistically represent the current weather.
3. **Customizable Update Frequency:** Allows users to specify how often the wallpaper should update to reflect changes in weather conditions.
4. **Simple GUI for Easy Configuration:** Includes a straightforward graphical user interface for setting up the application, including API key input and update frequency customization.
