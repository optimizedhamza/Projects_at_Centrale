# **Detection of Bots in Online Auctions**

## **Project Overview**
This machine learning project aims to identify automated bots among users in online auctions. Bots disrupt auctions by placing inappropriate or fraudulent bids, compromising the platform's integrity. Detecting these entities is crucial for ensuring a fair and transparent auction experience for human users.

## **Dataset**
The dataset comprises two main parts: bidder information (`train.csv` and `test.csv`) and auction details (`bids.csv`). It includes features such as bidder IDs, payment accounts, addresses, auction IDs, merchandise categories, bid times, countries, IP addresses, and URLs.

## **Project Relevance**
Identifying bots in online auctions is vital for preventing fraud, maintaining platform integrity, and protecting economic interests. It also offers insights into cybersecurity and behavioral analysis through machine learning techniques.

## **Technical Overview**
### Data Preparation
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and cleaning datasets to ensure data quality.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting meaningful features from raw data to highlight differences between human and bot activities.

### Machine Learning Pipeline
- **Library Imports**: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Model Selection**: Evaluating various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, RandomForest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using ROC-AUC scores, confusion matrices, and cross-validation techniques to assess model performance.

### Key Insights
- **Bot Detection**: Successfully identifying distinguishing behaviors between bots and humans.
- **Data Imbalance Handling**: Utilizing techniques like SMOTE for addressing data imbalance issues.

## **Conclusion**
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in distinguishing bots from human users in online auctions. Through careful data preparation, feature engineering, and model evaluation, we've laid the groundwork for enhancing the security and reliability of auction platforms.

## **Future Work**
- Further tuning of model hyperparameters.
- Exploration of deep learning techniques for potentially improved detection accuracy.
- Real-time bot detection implementation for live auction platforms.
